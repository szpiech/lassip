# LASSI Plus - a program to calculate haplotype frequency spectrum statistics

This is an implementation of various haplotype frequency spectrum statistics useful for detecting hard and soft selective sweeps in genomes. This program implements the following statistics:

lassip accepts VCF files, either phased (default, "hap" output files) or unphased (set --unphased, "mlg" output files), with or without missing data. lassip expectes one vcf file per contig, provided one at a time. You must provide a population file that specifies population IDs for each individual ID you wish to analyse. Only IDs listed in the population file will be analyzed, and if multiple populations are present, all statistics will be computed on a per-population basis.

Use --hapstats to compute H/G stats in sliding windows along the genome, whether or not data are phased determines whether H or G statistics are used. 

Use --lassi to compute the top K haplotype frequency specra in sliding windows along a contig. Pass multiple spectra files (e.g. from multiple contigs) with --spectra to run the CLR computation for detecting sweeps (Harris and DeGiorgio 2020).

If only --hapstats is given, files are named <basename>.lassip.[hap|mlg].stats.gz with format:

<chr>	<start>	<end>	<nSNPs>	<nHaps>	<uniqHaps>	<h12|g123>	<h2h1|g2g1>

The final 4 columns are repeated for each population in the analysis, with the population code prepended on the appropriate header label.

If only --lassi is given with --vcf, files are named <basename>.lassip.[hap|mlg].spectra.gz with format:

<header line for use with lassip when reading with --spectra>
<chr>	<start>	<end>	<nSNPs>	<nHaps>	<uniqHaps>	<hfs1>	...	<hfsK>

The final K+2 columns are repeated for each population in the analysis, with the population code prepended on the appropriate header label. hfsN gives the frequency of the Nth most common haplotype in the given window.

If both --lassi and --hapstats are given with --vcf, files are named <basename>.lassip.[hap|mlg].spectra.gz with format:

<header line for use with lassip when reading with --spectra>
<chr>	<start>	<end>	<nSNPs>	<nHaps>	<uniqHaps>	<h12|g123>	<h2h1|g2g1>	<hfs1>	...	<hfsK>

The final K+4 columns are repeated for each population in the analysis, with the population code prepended on the appropriate header label. hfsN gives the frequency of the Nth most common haplotype in the given window.

Passing *.spectra.gz files to lassip with --spectra <file1> ... <fileN> will compute the LASSI CLR and output a single file concatenating the results from all contigs, named <basename>.lassip.[hap|mlg].out.gz with one of two formats:

<chr>	<start>	<end>	<nSNPs>	<nHaps>	<uniqHaps>	<h12|g123>	<h2h1|g2g1>	<m>	<T>

or

<chr>	<start>	<end>	<nSNPs>	<nHaps>	<uniqHaps>	<m>	<T>

Depending on whether --hapstats was set when the *.spectra.gz files were generated. The final 4/6 columns are repeated for each population in the analysis, with the population code prepended on the appropriate header label. m gives the inferred number of sweeping haplotypes, and T gives the CLR test statistic (Harris and DeGiorgio 2020).
